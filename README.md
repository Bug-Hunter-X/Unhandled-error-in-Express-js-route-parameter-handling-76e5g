This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route parameter handling and its solution. The `bug.js` file shows the buggy code that doesn't handle the case where a requested user is not found. This leads to an unhandled error or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the 'user not found' scenario by returning a 404 status code.
